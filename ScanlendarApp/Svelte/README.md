# SMUI SvelteKit Example

An example project implementing [Svelte Material UI](https://github.com/hperrin/svelte-material-ui) with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

# Get it Running

1. Clone the repo.
2. `pnpm
 install`
3. `pnpm run dev`
4. http://localhost:3000

There is a workaround that runs to prepare @material packages for Vite. Without the workaround, you will see this issue.

```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../smui-example-sveltekit/node_modules/@material/ripple/index.ts'
```
